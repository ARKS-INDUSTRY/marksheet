# marksheet
code for marksheet application in tkinter
<br>
## This application will first ask you the marks of student in each subject,  of course his name and class , section
then you have to click the submit button to go to nect page 
This button will call a function to delete the previous components and then calculates the total  and average mark of the student.
then it will create some Labels to display the result and alsk there is a button to save the result in a file
which will be in .txt format. 
thats it thank you
